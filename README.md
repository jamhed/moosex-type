MooseX::Type
============

Existing Moose type system works as mere restriction to broader types, like you can restrict
a variable to be an integer in range of 1..100.

This package allows to introduce your own types, by utilizing the keyword type while defining
a Moose property. These types allows to override default Moose getter, setter and installer.

There are example types allowing smooth transition from Class::MethodMaker.
